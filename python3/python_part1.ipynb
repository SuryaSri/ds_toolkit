    "Python is the most popular language used for porgramming in the data science domain and a major reason for this is because of it's simplicity. While Python focuses on simplicity and ease of use, at the same time it sacrifices on speed, safety etc. However as a data scientist issues like safety and speed are not of much importance to us right now and when they do, we will use other frameworks designed specifically for production level systems.\n",

This guide is however not comprehensive. It is just a means to get ourselves comfortable with Python. For an in depth Python tutorial you can always refer the officical Python documentation.\n",

    "Python files are saved as `file_name.py` files and running them is quite easy. Here, we will go through 3 of the most popular approaches to Python programming and help you get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "This is the easiest approach to getting up and started with Python. This however requires extra software installation (Anaconda). You can download Anaconda distribution from [here.](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)\n",
    "Once istalled, run Jupyter Notebook, create a new notebook and you can get started immediately. A quick guide to Jypyter Notebook can be found [here.](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Using A Text Editor**\n",
    "A text editor is a program that lets you write code in a language of your choice and provides additional features like *syntax hilighting*, *code completion* etc. Popular text editors include [Atom,](https://atom.io/) [Sublime Text,](https://www.sublimetext.com/) [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) etc. The steps involved are:\n",
    " * Create a new Python 3 file and write code and save it.\n",
    " * Open terminal and navigate to the location where the file was saved.\n",
    " * Type `python3 file_name.py` to execute. If there are no errors, the file will run and the output will be visible on the terminal itself.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Using IDE**\n",
    "An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software that provides a complete package which includes a text editor, a compiler, a debugger, a project tracker etc. These are however best suited for commercial or production level software development and beginners best stay away from there. That being said, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a popular Python IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Alternatively, if you dont want to go through any of the above steps, you can visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) and execute your Python commands online using Google's servers.*"

For example, if we want to print all the numbers from 0 to 9 we can do it by writing one `print()` statement and looping over it without hard coding 10 different loop statements. The most commonly used loops in Python are **for loops** and **while loops**.\n",

    " * Since for loop creates the buffer when the loop is first called, changing the indices in the buffer are not possible and therefore we cannot skip over values.\n",
    " * The `range(a, b)` function in a for-loop includes `a` but excludes `b` so we need to specify `b+1` in order to count `b` also.\n",

    " * As long as the conditional expression evaluates to *True* the while loop executes and halts immediately when the expression evaluates to *False*.\n",

    "A function represents a group of instructions that perform a particular task. For example, we can have a function that calculates the square of a number, a function that prints a string in reverse order, a function that contains a loop and executes a particular task repeatedly. Functions are defined as `def function_name(...)` where `function_name` can be anything (as long as it is not a reserved keyword and follows the same rules as naming variables). The `()` after a name specify it is a function. For example `var` is a variable whereas `var()` is a function. The `...` inside the paranthesis of the funciton mean that we can also put extra information inside the function. The `def` is a keyword that tells the Python compiler that this is a function and all code indented below this is a part of the function.\n",

For example, they can be used to check if a number is even or odd, if a string is a palindrome etc. They can also be used to modify the values of the variable(s) of the main code to which they have access. Functions that are defined by parameters can take any type of arguments. The arguments can be variables, expressions, another function (return value), a list, a dictionary etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions that do not take arguments but return a value back to the program.** These functions always end with the keyword `return` and send something back to the main program which called the function in the first place. Since it does not take parameters it can only return information stored inside the function when it was created. For eg. we can have information retrieval functions which return the name of person when called. We can also have functions which return the current time or date etc. all of which do not require parameters but perform some type of information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functions that take arguments and return a value back to the program.** These functions also end with the keyword `return` but because they take arguments, these types of functions are the most versatile and powerful. They can be used for almost anything for eg. calculating the square of a number, taking an input string and reversing it etc.\n",

    "#### Note:\n",
    "* Python allows a default value to be set for the parameter. This means that if during function call the argument is not passed, then the function calculates using the default value.\n",
    "* All instructions in Python function are indented with 4 spaces.\n",
    "* We can even take input inside a function call as arguments.\n",
    "* The number of arguments that can be passed to a function depends on the Python version but it is best practice to keep number of arguments less than 5.\n",
    "* If we have functions nested inside functions, then the innermost function is the last to get called but first to get executed. Think of it like a stack approach to a function call. \n",
    "* `len` is a Python function that gives the number of bytes present in a string."

An even better solution is to use multiple nested `try-except` blocks for those parts of the code where we can anticipate an exception. Becuase of the nesting, all unhandled excpetions from inner `try-except` blocks will get passed to the outer ones which will try to handle them or pass them higher up. This reduces the chances of the program crashing drastically."
